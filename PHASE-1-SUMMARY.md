## Architecture Overview

```
Frontend Admin (React + Vite)
├── Products.tsx      (Create, CSV import, search, delete, paginate)
├── Orders.tsx        (List, detail modal, assign rider, status update)
├── Users.tsx         (Create, bulk assign role, view audit logs)
├── Categories.tsx    (Full CRUD inline edit)
├── Riders.tsx        (Create, edit, deactivate, delete)
└── Dashboard.tsx     (KPIs + charts)

Backend API (Node.js + Express)
├── Product APIs      (Create, import, update, delete — all audit-logged)
├── Category APIs     (Create, update, delete — all audit-logged)
├── Order APIs        (Admin get detail, assign rider, update status — all audit-logged)
├── Audit APIs        (Get logs, filter by resource/action)
├── User APIs         (Create, role assign, status, delete)
└── Role APIs         (Create, read, update, delete)

Database (MongoDB)
├── Users            (with roleId ref)
├── Products         (with categoryId ref)
├── Categories
├── Orders           (with userId, assignedRidarId refs)
├── Roles            (with permissions array)
├── Permissions
└── Audits ✅ NEW   (with actorId, before/after, meta)
```

## Testing Workflow

1. **Login** as superadmin
2. **Products**: Create 1, import 3 via CSV, delete 1
3. **Categories**: Create, edit, delete  
4. **Users**: Create admin user, create 3 rider users
5. **Riders**: Create 2 riders via Riders page (or Users → bulk assign rider role)
6. **Orders**: Click order → assign rider → change status
7. **Audit Logs**: Click "Audit Logs" on Users page → see all actions logged

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally** (follow PHASE-1-TESTING.md)
2. **Verify all permissions** work as expected
3. **Check audit logs** for all changes
4. **Plan Phase-2** (file upload, advanced filtering, real-time)
5. **Deploy to staging**
