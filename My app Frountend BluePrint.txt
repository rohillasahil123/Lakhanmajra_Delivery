Navigation Structure Suggestion (React Navigation use kar)

Stack Navigator (Auth flow): Splash → Onboarding → Login → OTP → Home
Bottom Tab Navigator (Main): Home | Search | Cart | Orders | Profile
Nested Stacks har tab ke andar (jaise Home → Category → Product Detail → Cart)

Tips React Native ke liye:

UI Library → NativeWind (Tailwind) + React Native Reanimated + Gesture Handler (smooth animations ke liye, Zepto jaisa feel aayega)
State Management → Zustand ya Redux Toolkit (cart, address, user ke liye)
Images → FastImage use kar (caching ke liye)
Skeleton Loading → har list/grid mein add kar (performance dikhega)
Bottom Sheet → @gorhom/bottom-sheet library (cart summary, coupons, address select ke liye best)
Map → react-native-maps (tracking ke liye)

Pehle core flow complete kar: Home → Search/Category → Product → Cart → Address → Payment → Tracking
