High-level implementation plan 🔧
Navigation
Add routing screens: app/signup.tsx, app/otp.tsx, app/location.tsx, app/checkout.tsx, app/order-tracking.tsx, app/payment.tsx, app/categories.tsx.
Use current root Stack for auth flow → tabs.
Shared UI components (create once, reuse)
components/ui/Header.tsx (green header with back and title)
components/ui/TextInput.tsx (label, error, icons)
components/ui/Button.tsx (primary orange, secondary green)
components/ui/OTPInput.tsx
components/ui/CategoryCard.tsx and components/ui/CartItem.tsx
Screens
Build Signup, OTP, Location (map picker), Checkout, Order Tracking, Payment, Categories using shared components.
Styling
Use existing tooling: Tailwind (nativewind) + small StyleSheet for complex elements.
Use ThemedText/ThemedView and theme.ts colors.
Map & images
For location screen, use react-native-maps (expo) or placeholder if native setup is not possible during first pass.
Accessibility & form validation
Basic validation for Signup/Checkout, keyboard types, focus flow.
Testing
Run on device/emulator & web; adjust spacing for small screens.
Required dependencies & notes ⚠️
Possible new packages: react-native-maps (expo install), react-native-gesture-handler if not already, maybe react-native-svg for icons. I’ll list exact commands before installing.
If you want pixel-perfect map features (location detection), we may need native permissions (Expo config).
7-day blueprint (day-by-day) 📅

Next actions (what I need from you) ▶️
Confirm platform(s) and which screen to start with (I recommend Signup).
Upload any brand assets (logo, exact brand colors, category images) if available.
Give permission to start implementing Signup screen — I’ll create files one-by-one and ask for approval before each file change.
If you approve, I’ll start by creating the Signup screen UI and the basic Button, TextInput, and Header components. Ready to proceed with Signup? ✅
